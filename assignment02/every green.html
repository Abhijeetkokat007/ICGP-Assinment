    <p> <u>Species of evergreen trees</u> such as spruce, pine, and fir trees keep their leaves throughout the year. There are about 14
         family groups of evergreen trees, and these trees provide color in gardens and landscapes all year long. Evergreen trees are the reason
          why forests look so beautiful in winter landscapes.
