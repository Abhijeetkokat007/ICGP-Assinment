    <h2>Economic importance</h2>
    <p> Of all the products that come from trees, those that are wood-based are by far of the greatest
        importance (see wood). Carbonized and fossilized wood (coal) supplies fuel for energy needs; other
         fossilized products of trees include amber, which is formed 
        from the gum of pines, and kauri gum. From earliest times wood has been employed for such items as
         homes, rafts, canoes, fuel, and weapons. <br/>  peoples were dependent on trees for many materials in addition to wood. 
         
         Fruits and nuts of many kinds were important foods for both humans and animals. Leaves of palms and other trees were used
          for thatching roofs. Cloth and woven fabrics made from bark, leaves, and other tree parts were used for clothing. Utensils
           were fashioned from calabashes, coconuts, and other fruits. Medicines, including quinine, were obtained from trees, as were
            dyes, tanning materials, and spices.

         Modern civilizations are no less dependent on trees. Although substitutes now are commonly used for some tree products, 
         the demand for trees remains strong, as in the manufacture of newsprint and other papers, as well as cardboard and similar
          packagings. The plywood industry converts immense numbers of trees into building materials.</p><br/><hr/>
          <h3>Etymology</h3>
          <p>
            The German-Australian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller gave the genus the name Macadamia in 1857 in honour of the Scottish-Australian
            chemist, medical teacher, and politician John Macadam, who was the honorary Secretary of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria 
            beginning in 1857.</p>
