    <p>  All types of trees play an important role in our ecosystem. Trees provide shade, shelter, oxygen, and many even produce fruit. 
        There are over 60,000 species of trees that come in all shapes and sizes, from majestic cedars to smaller fruit trees and shrubs. 
        Identifying the different kinds of trees usually depends on examining their leaves and bark. Some types of trees have wide oval leaves,
         some have star-shaped ones, and many evergreen trees have needle leaves. <br> All species of trees are classified into two main types:
          deciduous trees and evergreen trees. Deciduous trees shed their leaves at a certain time of the year â€“ usually in the autumn while types 
          of evergreen trees keep their leaves throughout the year.

         Trees are woody perennial plants that are a member of the kingdom Plantae. All species of trees are grouped by their genus, family, and
          order. This helps make identifying and studying trees easier.
         
         Apart from providing oxygen for the planet and beauty when they bloom or turn color, trees are very useful. Certain species of hardwood 
         and softwood trees are excellent for timber, making furniture, and paper. When managed properly, trees are a good source of renewable 
         energy and construction material.</p>
    <h2>Growth Regions Tree</h2>

    <p>As vascular plants, trees are organized into three major organs: the <u>roots</u>, 
        the <u>stems</u>, and the <u>leaves</u>. The leaves are the principal photosynthetic organs 
        of most higher vascular plants. They are attached by a continuous vascular system
         to the rest of the plant so that free exchange of nutrients, water, and end
          products of photosynthesis (oxygen and carbohydrates in particular) can be
           carried to its various parts.<br/>
           The stem is divided into nodes (points where leaves are or were attached) and internodes (the
            length of the stem between nodes). The leaves and stem together are called the shoot. Shoots can be separated 
            into long shoots and short shoots on the basis of the distance between buds (internode length). The stem provides support, 
            water and food conduction, and storage.
