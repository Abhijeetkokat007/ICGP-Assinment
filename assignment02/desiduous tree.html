    <p> Deciduous trees are the kind of trees that lose their leaves at certain times of the year. The term deciduous literally means to “fall off at 
        maturity.”  <br>
        In North America, Europe, and temperate counties, deciduous trees such as oak, walnut, elm, and birch shed their leaves in fall. This is
         usually preceded by the leaves turning wonderful colors including shades of orange, brown, and yellow.

        In tropical countries, species of deciduous trees lose their leaves during dry seasons. </p><br/><hr/>

        <h3> Deciduous woody plants</h3>

        <p> 
            The deciduous characteristic has developed repeatedly among woody plants. Trees include maple, many oaks and nothofagus, elm, beech, aspen, and birch, 
            among others, as well as a number of coniferous genera, such as larch and Metasequoia. Deciduous shrubs include honeysuckle, viburnum, and many others. 
            Most temperate woody vines are also deciduous, including grapes, poison ivy, Virginia creeper, wisteria, etc. The characteristic is useful in plant
             identification; for instance in parts of Southern California and the American Southeast, deciduous and evergreen oak species may grow side by side.
            
            Periods of leaf fall often coincide with seasons: winter in the case of cool-climate plants or the dry-season in the case of tropical plants,[18] however
             there are no deciduous species among tree-like monocotyledonous plants, e.g. palms, yuccas, and dracaenas. The hydrangea hirta is a deciduous woody shrub 
             found in Japan.</p>
