    <p>  Mangroves are not the only trees that spread by dropping prop roots from their branches. The habit is well developed in several
         tropical figs (Ficus), including one popular in small sizes as a houseplantâ€”the rubber plant (F. elastica). Most noteworthy of the 
         group is the banyan tree (F. benghalensis) of India; its numerous prop roots develop into secondary trunks that support the
          widespreading head of massive, constantly extending branches.  <br> One specimen in Calcutta covers an area more than 250 metres 
          (about 275 yards) wide. The wonderboom (F. salicifolia) of Africa grows in a similar manner; a specimen at Pretoria has a spread of 50 
          metres (55 yards). Because of their unusual growth habits, some tropical ficuses are called strangler figs. Often they begin life high 
          in a palm or some other tree in which a monkey, bat, or bird that has fed on the fruits deposits seeds that have passed through its 
          alimentary tract. The seeds germinate, and the roots grow into organic matter collected in crotches or crevices of the host tree. Under
           humid conditions the seedlings grow rapidly, sending roots down along the trunk of the host tree. Upon reaching the ground the roots 
           branch and establish themselves. Above the ground the roots thicken until they have formed an interlacing cylinder around the trunk of
            the host, often leading to the death of the host tree. </p><br/>
